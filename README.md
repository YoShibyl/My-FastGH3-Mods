# Yoshibyl's mods for FastGH3
[FastGH3](https://github.com/donnaken15/FastGH3) is a modified version of *Guitar Hero III* for PC that allows the user to quickly load and play custom song charts.  Since version 1.1, it allows for loading QB mods, in the form of `*.qb.xen` files.

## Acceleration Mode
This is the first of my mods for FastGH3.  It makes the game speed up with every note hit, and steadily slow down while the current note streak is zero.  Currently, the speed increments and limits are hardcoded, and the song speed set in FastGH3 settings won't affect the base/starting speed, but that may change to become configurable soon.

[Here's a video showcasing the mod in action!](https://youtu.be/LJt_AqU60Hk)

## Installation (`*.qb.xen` mods)
1. Open FastGH3's settings (Run `FastGH3.exe -settings` *or* the `settings.bat` file in the FastGH3 installation folder)
2. Click the QB Mods button, then click the plus **[+]** button in the bottom-left corner of the dialog.  From here, navigate to where you downloaded the mod `.qb.xen` file, and select it.
3. Load your favorite chart, and enjoy the suffering!

To disable a mod, click on the mod in the QB Mods dialog, and check the Disable box.  Alternatively, you can uninstall it completely by clicking the minus **[-]** button.
